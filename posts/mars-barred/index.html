This, I think, is a consequence of more people having gotten their science education from the movie character Ian Malcolm than from actual science classes. More generously, it is a testament to humans having formulated nearly all of their ideas about the nature of life from the absolute easiest (and only known) place to have life.</p></blockquote><p>Source: <a href="https://defector.com/neither-elon-musk-nor-anybody-else-will-ever-colonize-mars">Neither Elon Musk Nor Anybody Else Will Ever Colonize Mars</a></p><p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDh2QTYYA6o">The Mars crisis, explained by 2 experts</a> covers even more reasons that weâ€™re not going to Mars (from the writers of <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal Comics</a>).</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 13, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/tags/cold-showers/">cold showers</a></li><li><a href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/tags/mars/">mars</a></li><li><a href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/tags/space-travel/">space travel</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/authors/elio-grieco/" rel="author">Elio Grieco</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/posts/hard-vs-easy-languages/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Hard vs Easy Languages</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://www.constantlyunderwhelmed.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
