This, I think, is a consequence of more people having gotten their science education from the movie character Ian Malcolm than from actual science classes. More generously, it is a testament to humans having formulated nearly all of their ideas about the nature of life from the absolute easiest (and only known) place to have life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://defector.com/neither-elon-musk-nor-anybody-else-will-ever-colonize-mars\">Neither Elon Musk Nor Anybody Else Will Ever Colonize Mars</a></p><p>And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDh2QTYYA6o\">The Mars crisis, explained by 2 experts</a> covers even more reasons that we’re not going to Mars (from the writers of <a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/\">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal Comics</a>).</p>",

Healthcare leaders too often identify “re-education” as a solution to a multitude of problems. <strong>A solution like “re-education” rests on the assumption that the system itself is not the problem. Without changing the causal system, the leaders will likely find that a need for “re-education” keeps recurring.</strong> Among the sample of ideas presented for what to do differently to mitigate unwarranted practice variation: In general, design systems so that doing the right thing is the easiest way to do the work; a checklist is one example. Confirm that assumed processes indeed exist and unfold predictably and within desired limits.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-94655-5_19\">Source</a>: Schulman, J.
