<p>On what type of timeframe were you imagining that the shoebox of lichen you send to Mars was going to transform Frozen Airless Radioactive Desert Hell into a place where people could grow wheat?</p><p>People have this idea that life is like some kind of magical force; that the reason Mars does not have life is that life has not yet gone there; that once life goes to a place, then it just figures out how to go on living there. This, I think, is a consequence of more people having gotten their science education from the movie character Ian Malcolm than from actual science classes. More generously, it is a testament to humans having formulated nearly all of their ideas about the nature of life from the absolute easiest (and only known) place to have life.</p></blockquote>

                <p>This quote applies equally well to cybersecurity, software design, and the broader tech industry:</p><blockquote>
<p>The insight that “Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets,” together with its corollary, “If we keep doing what we’ve been doing, we’ll keep getting what we’ve been getting,” provide profound insight for mitigating the problem of unwarranted practice variation. Healthcare leaders too often identify “re-education” as a solution to a multitude of problems. <strong>A solution like “re-education” rests on the assumption that the system itself is not the problem. Without changing the causal system, the leaders will likely find that a need for “re-education” keeps recurring.</strong> Among the sample of ideas presented for what to do differently to mitigate unwarranted practice variation: In general, design systems so that doing the right thing is the easiest way to do the work; a checklist is one example. Confirm that assumed processes indeed exist and unfold predictably and within desired limits.</p></blockquote>
